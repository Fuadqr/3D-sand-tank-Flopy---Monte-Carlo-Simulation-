# 3D-sand-tank-Flopy---Monte-Carlo-Simulation
The Flopy package was used to create a groundwater model of a small sand tank (1.3x0.7x0.4 meters). The purpose of this model is to use Monte Carlo simulation to find the optimal values for the hydraulic parameters of the sand tank. To do this, observed BTCs (breakthrough curves) are compared to simulated BTCs, and statistical measures such as RMSE and R2 are used to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated data. Additional objective functions, such as time to peak and maximum concentration, may also be used to assess the performance of the model. By running the model multiple times with different values for the hydraulic parameters and comparing the simulated BTCs to the observed BTCs, the optimal range of values for the hydraulic parameters can be identified.
